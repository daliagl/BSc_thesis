Documentation that I used for my thesis

I graduated from the Bachelors in Physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (U.N.A.M.) in December of 2019. This research was implemented in the Quantum Optics Experimental Laboratory at the Nuclear Science Institute (I.C.N. - U.N.A.M.) in the period of March 2018 to April 2019, includes the experimental data (it was carried out by MSc Monica Maldonado, Dr Josue Hernandez and myself) and numerical simulations. Also, there is a paper related to this work (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.013802) that sums up various experiments and publications related to the heralded photons propierties of structured light (Bessel-Gauss Beams) in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion.
